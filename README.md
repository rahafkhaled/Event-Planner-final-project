# Event-Planner-final-project
An event planner based on a client-server network. This program is a container for everything an event manager would need to put an event together. The software displays possible options, allows customers and suppliers to chat, and automatically orders and books things, and updates the host every time there's a change to the event.
The main libraries that will be used for this program are socket and Tkinter.
The graphical user interface for this program is very interactive:
First Page will be titled "Create Event" and will have:
Event name
Event Type
Number of people
Second page will be titled "Event Regestration" and will have:
Date/Time of event
Host name
Host's contact information
Third page is the dashboard,this is where clients organize their events and manage parts of it. It contains:
All events created with a manage and delete button.
A menu with everything there is to manage for that specific event,such as:
1-Venue-with a filter
2-Catering (food)-with a filter
3-Flowers-with a filter
4-Guest List-can put in their information if the client wants to send E-invites
5-Decor
The final page of an event is a full summary of the event that the client can keep a copy of.
